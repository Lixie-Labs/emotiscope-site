# the **remote control**

If your phone didn't automatically forward you to the Emotiscope web app, then you can access it from the button below. Play some funky tunes, and enjoy. *Come back here if you want to learn more!*

# the **full tour**

I've tried my best to keep Emotiscope's remote as simple as possible, with only one main function to learn: **Sliders**. If you've ever used a dimmer switch, *you already understand Sliders.* Too dim? Pull up. Too colorful? Pull down.

You'll always see three Sliders on-screen at a given time, but you can always swipe horizontally to scroll through the Slider Gallery.

{: .warning }
While the advice in this section is likely correct in 99% of cases, ALWAYS double check the labelling and color scheme of the wires in your own LED strip to be sure that nothing will be damaged.

Once the wires are stripped, insert them into the LED terminal as shown, tightening the screws down on the wires as you go. Be sure that none of the bare wire is exposed, so that it cannot short-circuit with itself. (If you're using a 4-wire strip, be sure to hook up all four wires correctly.)

{: .highlight }
Some strips have duplicate wires for 5V and GND. These can be wired to a separate power supply, individually covered with electrical tape, or doubled-up into the corresponding terminals if you plan to power the LEDs using only the Sensory Bridge.
