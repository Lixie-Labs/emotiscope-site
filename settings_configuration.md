# SETTINGS CONFIGURATION

To change the settings on your device, visit [settings.sensorybridge.rocks](https://settings.sensorybridge.rocks) on a computer with your Sensory Bridge plugged in. You'll be asked to choose your device from a list, and in most cases you'll only see one option.

[Click to Configure Your Sensory Bridge](https://settings.sensorybridge.rocks){: .btn .btn-blue }

![SENSORY BRIDGE IS SIMPLE](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/settings_page_pic.png?raw=true)

(Come back to that settings page after this tutorial and have a look around at some neat options it has!)

> *4-WIRE LED STRIP USERS:*
> 
> On the settings page, in the LEDS section, change the "TYPE" from "NEOPIXEL" (the default) to "DOTSTAR (4-WIRE)". This will make your LED strip finally light up normally! Your extra effort won't go unnoticed, as 4-wire strips have higher frame rate capabilities than others!
