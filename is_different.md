# emotiscope&nbsp;is **different**

**This isn't the usual "sound-reactive LEDs" you've seen for years.**

**Emotiscope was built by [@lixielabs](https://leds.social/@lixielabs) from the ground up as an open, powerful bridge between sight and sound.** With a show that's reactive to notation, vibrato, tempo, and more, it produces very unique and pleasant-to-look-at light shows which synchronize to your music without any visible latency whatsoever.

With a magic diffuser covering 128 of the world's smallest addressable LEDs - which are being refreshed at up 450 FPS - Emotiscope doesn't looks like a screen. It looks more like some kind of neon-gas display from the far future or recent past.

With it's built-in digital microphone, Emotiscope automatically converts any music playing in your space into a compelling and colorful show. No aux cables needed, you can even sing around it!
