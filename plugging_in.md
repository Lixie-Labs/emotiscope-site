# PLUGGING IN FOR THE FIRST TIME

You're almost ready to go! Next, plug a 5V/2A USB-C cable into the port at the rear of the unit. If all is well, you should see the "Sweet Spot" LEDs light up.

**Turn the three knobs all the way up to the following position:**

{: .warning }
If you have a 4-wire LED strip, it won't work until the next section of the tutorial!

Do you see your LED strip lighting up? Does it flash when you snap your fingers? If not, something could be wrong. Unplug your Sensory Bridge, double-check your wiring, or try the Sensory Bridge Troubleshooting Guide

# SETTINGS CONFIGURATION

To change the settings on your device, visit settings.sensorybridge.rocks on a computer, with your Sensory Bridge plugged into your computer. You'll be asked to choose your device from a list, and in most cases you'll only see one option.

[Click to Configure Your Sensory Bridge](https://settings.sensorybridge.rocks){: .btn .btn-blue }

(Come back to that settings page after this tutorial and have a look around at some neat options it has!)

> *4-WIRE LED STRIP USERS:*
> 
> On the settings page, in the LEDS section, change the "TYPE" from "NEOPIXEL" (the default) to "DOTSTAR (4-WIRE)". This will make your LED strip finally light up normally! Your extra effort won't go unnoticed, as 4-wire strips have higher frame rate capabilities than others!

# INITIAL CALIBRATION

Sensory Bridge has the ability to ignore consistent ambient noise in the room, such as computer fans, washing machines, etc..

To set this up, first make sure that no music is already playing in the room - only the ambient noise you want to remove. (No talking either) Then, press the <sb-button>NOISE BUTTON</sb-button> to start the calibration. This will only take about 3 seconds, and you'll see a pink-colored graph of the captured noise on the LED strip during the process.

Did it work? Your LED strip should now stay completely off when you're not making noise or playing music, try it out! You can repeat the calibration at any time, which I would recommend doing if your Sensory Bridge is moved to another room or when ambient conditions change.

# FIRST TESTS

You next move should be to dial back that <sb-knob>MOOD KNOB</sb-knob> to 50% or so. This is the range which produces the nicest shows with the most music types. 100% "mood" is great for home raves, 10% is great for extremely mellow shows.

Now, try it out!

Put some awesome music on. Play with the <sb-button>MODE BUTTON</sb-button> to try different versions of the show, and adjusting the <sb-knob>MOOD KNOB</sb-knob> to your liking. Turn down the <sb-knob>PHOTONS KNOB</sb-knob> if you find the show to be too bright for you.

For the best results, place your Sensory Bridge as close to the music source as possible.

DID YOU KNOW? Holding down the <sb-button>MODE BUTTON</sb-button> for longer than 0.5 seconds will toggle a mirrored version of the current light show!

Below are some YouTube links to songs that I enjoy on Sensory Bridge:

# SWEET SPOT and CHROMA

Lastly, let's discuss the "Sweet Spot" indicator, and what the <sb-knob>CHROMA KNOB</sb-knob> does.

"Sweet Spot" indicates if your audio is too quiet (too close to the ambient sound of the room) or too loud (nearing distortion) when playing. The Green LED in the center should always be lit whenever sound is playing.

{: .info }
If you find your Sensory Bridge isn't as sensitive to your music as you'd like (maybe you can't turn the music up any farther?) then you can adjust the "SENSITIVITY" value on the configuration page.

The <sb-knob>CHROMA KNOB</sb-knob> lets you manually choose the base hue that all lightshows are derived from. Turning the <sb-knob>CHROMA KNOB</sb-knob> all the way up to the end (100%) tells Sensory Bridge to let its own color algorithm take over, cycling color on cue with the music.

{: .highlight }
NO CHROMA KNOB? You likely have an original Sensory Bridge unit with a <sb-knob>BOOST KNOB</sb-knob> instead. No worries! If you're running the latest firmware, audio sensitivity is automatically managed and your <sb-knob>BOOST KNOB</sb-knob> now controls colors instead.
