The day is finally here! Grab yourself a USB-C cable, remove the protective cover on the back of Emotiscope, and plug it in!

Suddenly, it lives. Talk to it! See how your voice affects the display. Hold your fingers on the top, left or right sides to see what happens. It's listening through a microphone behind the left-side hole. However, the hole on the right side is flashing - meaning Emotiscope can't connect to your WiFi.
