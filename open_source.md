# SENSORY BRIDGE is **OPEN**

Powered by an ESP32-S2, Sensory Bridge can be easily reprogrammed for any purpose you'd like! The firmware is [open source](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge) under the [MIT License](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/blob/main/LICENSE), so modifying it for your own purposes is quick and easy with the Arduino IDE. You can even download the [board](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/tree/main/extras/OSHW/PCB) and [case STLs](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/tree/main/extras/OSHW/3D%20Printing) to build one yourself!

## NOTE FROM THE CREATOR

### Anything about your Sensory Bridge can be modified, replaced or fixed with the right tools, which Lixie Labs believes is your right as a consumer.

In exchange, please support my continued work on Open Hardware products by purchasing from my store or donating through my GitHub Sponsors program. I create these products with great passion and obsession to make them fun and modular experiences, and your contibutions have kept me afloat through thick and thin.
