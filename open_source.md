# SENSORY BRIDGE is **OPEN**

Powered by an ESP32-S2, Sensory Bridge can be easily reprogrammed for any purpose you'd like! The firmware is [open source](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge) under the [MIT License](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/blob/main/LICENSE), so modifying it for your own purposes is quick and easy with the Arduino IDE. You can even download the [board](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/tree/main/extras/OSHW/PCB) and [case STLs](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/tree/main/extras/OSHW/3D%20Printing) to build one yourself!
