# FIRST TESTS

You next move should be to dial back that <sb-knob>MOOD KNOB</sb-knob> to 50% or so. This is the range which produces the nicest shows with the most music types. 100% "mood" is great for home raves, 10% is great for extremely mellow shows.

<div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:36px;">Now, try it out!</div>

Put some awesome music on. Play with the <sb-button>MODE BUTTON</sb-button> to try different versions of the show, and adjusting the <sb-knob>MOOD KNOB</sb-knob> to your liking. Turn down the <sb-knob>PHOTONS KNOB</sb-knob> if you find the show to be too bright for you.

For the best results, place your Sensory Bridge as close to the music source as possible.

DID YOU KNOW? Holding down the <sb-button>MODE BUTTON</sb-button> for longer than 0.5 seconds will toggle a mirrored version of the current light show!

Below are some YouTube links to songs that I enjoy on Sensory Bridge:
