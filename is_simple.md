# EMOTISCOPE&nbsp;is **SIMPLE**

Emotiscope has two types of controls: touch and wireless!

![TOUCH](https://github.com/lixie-labs/emotiscope/blob/main/extras/img/emotiscope_touch_crop.jpg?raw=true)

## Touch

Emotiscope has three touch points: the top, left, and right side. Holding your finger on the left or right side allows you to change the color of the show, tapping the top skips to the next light-show mode, and holding down on the top puts Emotiscope to sleep, entirely disabling the microphone and playing a short visual outro. Once asleep, tapping the device will instantly wake it up, ready for another stellar show.

**TODO: TOUCH DEMO LOOP VIDEO HERE**

## WIRELESS

For more flexible control, there's the Emotiscope app. No downloads, no install, no account, no subscription, simply visit [app.emotiscope.rocks](https://app.emotiscope.rocks/) from any phone on the same WiFi network as Emotiscope to be automatically connected in seconds. (You can even bookmark it to your home screen!)

Once there, you're greeted with a very simple interface with only one concept to learn: sliders.

Sliders work like knobs to control things like brightness, color, reaction speed, and more. Just drag your thumb up and down anywhere on the slider to alter it, and your changes are automatically saved to Emotiscope.

--------------------------------------------


**Easy controls provide quick access to changing the brightness, color, and smoothing of the display!** (Each knob has a UI that appears on your LED strip whenever you turn them.)

![photons](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/photons.svg?raw=true){: .sb-icon }

PHOTONS
{: .text-center .fs-7 .fw-700 }

Too bright? *Dim down the show* with the **PHOTONS** knob. (Sensory Bridge will use temporal dithering to keep producing color nicely at lower brightness levels.)

![chroma](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/chroma.svg?raw=true){: .sb-icon }

CHROMA
{: .text-center .fs-7 .fw-700 }

Custom color or color based on the music's notation? Choose your style with the **CHROMA** knob, where turning it all the way to the top enables a full-specrum mode that colors the LEDs based on the music notation. (Each octave is represented by one full revolution of the color wheel, i.e. D# in every octave is always yellow.)

![mood](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/mood.svg?raw=true){: .sb-icon } 

MOOD
{: .text-center .fs-7 .fw-700 }

This knob is special. **MOOD** controls *how quickly your LEDs will react to changes in pitch and volume!* A low "mood" will be very soft and gradual, only showing things like the underlying chord progression of a song, whereas a *high* "mood" will be extremely reactive, and can be a little too flashy for some people's liking. Luckily, you can blend the value to anywhere between those two extremes whenever you want to find what look you prefer!

![noise](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/noise.svg?raw=true){: .sb-icon }

NOISE BUTTON
{: .text-center .fs-7 .fw-700 }

Running the A/C? Is the washing machine suddenly on the spin cycle? Don't worry, just pause the music for a moment and press the **NOISE BUTTON** to run a 3-second calibration to *automagically* have noisy background ambience removed from your light show.

![mode](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/mode.svg?raw=true){: .sb-icon }

MODE BUTTON
{: .text-center .fs-7 .fw-700 }

Sensory Bridge currently has 6 built-in light show modes that you can cycle through with a tap, and holding this button toggles the mirroring effect on the LED strip.

![sweet_spot](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/sweet_spot.svg?raw=true){: .sb-icon }

SWEET SPOT
{: .text-center .fs-7 .fw-700 }

At the front of Sensory Bridge are three LEDs which indicate if your music is playing too quietly or loudly for the auto-ranger to account for! That auto-ranging system make both quiet and loud music produce similar shows, so you don't have to keep adjusting your speakers.
