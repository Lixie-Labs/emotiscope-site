# SENSORY BRIDGE is **OPEN**

Powered by an ESP32-S2, Sensory Bridge can be easily reprogrammed for any purpose you'd like! The firmware is [open source](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge) under the [MIT License](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/blob/main/LICENSE), so modifying it for your own purposes is quick and easy with the Arduino IDE. You can even download the [board](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/tree/main/extras/OSHW/PCB) and [case STLs](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/tree/main/extras/OSHW/3D%20Printing) to build one yourself!

![WHATS INCLUDED](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/blob/main/extras/img/8.jpg?raw=true)

# WHAT'S **INCLUDED:**

For $60, you'll receive a ***fully assembled Sensory Bridge***, with the latest firmware already installed. For $40 extra, you can have a **Mini Mast** (128 micro-LED PCB, seen above) sent as well, with an accompanying brace that provides rigidity. (It just plugs right into the accessory port on top of Sensory Bridge!)

# EXTRAS YOU **MIGHT NEED:**

## **PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THIS SECTION!**

To save on redundant materials you might already own, **your Sensory Bridge does *not* come with the following items:**

- **WS2812B LED Strip** - "144-LEDs per meter" variants are recommended, you can cut the 16 excess LEDs off of the end of the strip or reconfigure your device to interpolate to the 144-LED length at a slightly lower frame rate.

- **USB-C Cable** ([AMAZON LINK](https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Charger-Braided-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B076FPGWNZ/ref=sr_1_9?crid=2YG0J3B874G73&keywords=usb-c+cable&qid=1662388265&sprefix=usb-c+cable%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-9))
- **5V, 2A USB Power Adapter** ([AMAZON LINK](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Charger-FONKEN-Universal-Compatible/dp/B07DF782WQ/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1WJDP9XHVR3QC&keywords=2a+usb+adapter&qid=1662388344&sprefix=2a+usb+adapter%2Caps%2C131&sr=8-4))
- **Wire Stripper** - If you'd like to use your Sensory Bridge with your own LED strip, you'll either need a wire stripper or strong teeth to get it hooked up neatly! These clamp-style strippers make that process a breeze, so please don't use your teeth: ([AMAZON LINK](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Adjusting-Stripper-Klein-Tools-11061/dp/B00CXKOEQ6/ref=sr_1_5?crid=UIAP8SCLPER3&keywords=wire+strippers&qid=1662390513&sprefix=wire+strippers%2Caps%2C141&sr=8-5))

![FUTURE PLANS](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/blob/main/extras/img/0.jpg?raw=true)

# FUTURE **PLANS**

Sensory Bridge is going to undergo some upgrades in the following months! You'll be able to easily [update to the latest firmware in minutes with this guide](DEAD LINK).

**Currently planned features are:**

## WiFi Features

Planned for Q1 2023 is a mobile / web app for iOS and Android that will allow users to remotely tweak their display from the couch! This will provide a way to adjust dozens of settings that otherwise couldn't be accessed through just two physical buttons.

## More Lightshow Modes

Currently in development is a system of determining and synchronizing to the BPM of the playing music. Combining this data with the GDFT could mean deducing time signatures, along with musical keys and chord progressions - just another avenue for providing an immersive show!

![AUX PORT](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/blob/main/extras/img/15.jpg?raw=true)

## Support For Line-In Audio

The accessory port exposes GPIO 17/18 of the ESP32-S2, which are analog inputs. In the future, a PCB can be made to allow Sensory Bridge to use hardwired, passthrough audio via two 3.5mm jacks. This concept does not interfere with the Mini Mast, and the two accessories will be stackable with a modified brace.
