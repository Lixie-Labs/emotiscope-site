# INITIAL CALIBRATION

Sensory Bridge has the ability to ignore consistent ambient noise in the room, such as computer fans, washing machines, etc..

To set this up, first make sure that no music is already playing in the room - only the ambient noise you want to remove. (No talking either) Then, press the <sb-button>NOISE BUTTON</sb-button> to start the calibration. This will only take about 3 seconds, and you'll see a pink-colored graph of the captured noise on the LED strip during the process.

Did it work? Your LED strip should now stay nearly off when you're not making noise or playing music, try it out! You can repeat the calibration at any time, which I would recommend doing if your Sensory Bridge is moved to another room or whenever ambient conditions change.
