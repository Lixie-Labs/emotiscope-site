# Print Your Own Emotiscope Parts

Want to print your parts in other colors? There's endless options. (You'll want a full-size 3D printer for some pieces)

**DISCLAIMER:**

*Emotiscope has 128 very delicate LEDs inside. There is double-sided tape holding a two-halved LED Spacer piece to the circuit board behind it. Lixie Labs assumes no responsibility for broken LED strips as a result of modifying or replacing the LED Spacer piece, so only replace it if you're an experienced maker aware of the risk. Just don't apply any lateral forces to them, and it should be fine.*

-------------------------------------------------

## Plastic

By default, Emotiscope is printed in [Galaxy Black PLA by Prusa Research](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-pla-prusa-galaxy-black-1kg/), at a 0.2mm layer height.

## Nuts and Bolts

Emotiscope uses M3 hex screws and nuts to stay together:

| M3 Nut     | M3 Screw (14mm)   | M3 Screw (16mm)  |
|:-----------|:------------------|:-----------------|
| 4          | 2                 | 2                |

{: .info }
The M3 nuts friction-fit with their plastic counterparts, and can be nearly impossible to remove once inserted. Make sure to buy some spares for experimentation.
