# FIRST TESTS

You next move should be to dial back that <sb-knob>MOOD KNOB</sb-knob> to 50% or so. This is the range which produces the nicest shows with the most music types. 100% "mood" is great for home raves, 10% is great for extremely mellow shows.

Now, try it out!

Put some awesome music on. Play with the <sb-button>MODE BUTTON</sb-button> to try different versions of the show, and adjusting the <sb-knob>MOOD KNOB</sb-knob> to your liking. Turn down the <sb-knob>PHOTONS KNOB</sb-knob> if you find the show to be too bright for you.

For the best results, place your Sensory Bridge as close to the music source as possible.

DID YOU KNOW? Holding down the <sb-button>MODE BUTTON</sb-button> for longer than 0.5 seconds will toggle a mirrored version of the current light show!

Below are some YouTube links to songs that I enjoy on Sensory Bridge:

# SWEET SPOT and CHROMA

Lastly, let's discuss the "Sweet Spot" indicator, and what the <sb-knob>CHROMA KNOB</sb-knob> does.

"Sweet Spot" indicates if your audio is too quiet (too close to the ambient sound of the room) or too loud (nearing distortion) when playing. The Green LED in the center should always be lit whenever sound is playing.

If you find your Sensory Bridge isn't as sensitive to your music as you'd like (maybe you can't turn the music up any farther?) then you can adjust the "SENSITIVITY" value on the configuration page.

The <sb-knob>CHROMA KNOB</sb-knob> lets you manually choose the base hue that all lightshows are derived from. Turning the <sb-knob>CHROMA KNOB</sb-knob> all the way up to the end (100%) tells Sensory Bridge to let its own color algorithm take over, cycling color on cue with the music.

NO CHROMA KNOB? You likely have an original Sensory Bridge unit with a <sb-knob>BOOST KNOB</sb-knob> instead. No worries! If you're running the latest firmware, audio sensitivity is automatically managed and your <sb-knob>BOOST KNOB</sb-knob> now controls colors instead.
