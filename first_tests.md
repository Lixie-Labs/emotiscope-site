# FIRST TESTS

You next move should be to dial back that <sb-knob>MOOD&nbsp;KNOB</sb-knob> to 50% or so. This is the range which produces the nicest shows with the most music types. 100% "mood" is great for home raves, 10% is great for extremely mellow shows.

Put some awesome music on. Play with the <sb-button>MODE&nbsp;BUTTON</sb-button> to try different versions of the show, and adjusting the <sb-knob>MOOD&nbsp;KNOB</sb-knob> to your liking. Turn down the <sb-knob>PHOTONS&nbsp;KNOB</sb-knob> if you find the show to be too bright for you.

For the best results, place your Sensory Bridge as close to the music source as possible.

Holding down the <sb-button>MODE BUTTON</sb-button> for longer than 0.5 seconds will toggle a mirrored version of the current light show!
