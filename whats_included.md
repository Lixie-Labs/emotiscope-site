# WHAT'S **INCLUDED:**

For $60, you'll receive a ***fully assembled Sensory Bridge***, with the latest firmware already installed. For $40 extra, you can have a **Mini Mast** (128 micro-LED PCB, seen above) sent as well, with an accompanying brace that provides rigidity. (It just plugs right into the accessory port on top of Sensory Bridge!)

# EXTRAS YOU **MIGHT NEED:**

## **PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THIS SECTION!**

To save on redundant materials you might already own, **your Sensory Bridge does *not* come with the following items:**

- **WS2812B LED Strip** - "144-LEDs per meter" variants are recommended, you can cut the 16 excess LEDs off of the end of the strip or reconfigure your device to interpolate to the 144-LED length at a slightly lower frame rate.

- **USB-C Cable** ([AMAZON LINK](https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Charger-Braided-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B076FPGWNZ/ref=sr_1_9?crid=2YG0J3B874G73&keywords=usb-c+cable&qid=1662388265&sprefix=usb-c+cable%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-9))
- **5V, 2A USB Power Adapter** ([AMAZON LINK](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Charger-FONKEN-Universal-Compatible/dp/B07DF782WQ/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1WJDP9XHVR3QC&keywords=2a+usb+adapter&qid=1662388344&sprefix=2a+usb+adapter%2Caps%2C131&sr=8-4))
- **Wire Stripper** - If you'd like to use your Sensory Bridge with your own LED strip, you'll either need a wire stripper or strong teeth to get it hooked up neatly! These clamp-style strippers make that process a breeze, so please don't use your teeth: ([AMAZON LINK](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Adjusting-Stripper-Klein-Tools-11061/dp/B00CXKOEQ6/ref=sr_1_5?crid=UIAP8SCLPER3&keywords=wire+strippers&qid=1662390513&sprefix=wire+strippers%2Caps%2C141&sr=8-5))
