# Open Source Hardware

Want to print your parts in other colors? Make it taller? Add more knobs? Sensory Bridge is Open Source Hardware under the [CERN-OHL-W-2.0 License](https://spdx.org/licenses/CERN-OHL-W-2.0.html), and anything you need to know about its internal parts can be found below.

-------------------------------------------------

## Plastic

Sensory Bridge is printed in [Galaxy Black PLA by Prusa Research](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-pla-prusa-galaxy-black-1kg/), at a 0.2mm layer height.

### Shell (Sensory Bridge)

### Brace (Mini Mast)

-------------------------------------------------

## Nuts and Bolts

Sensory Bridge uses M3 screws and nuts to stay together:

| Product              | M3 Nut     | M3 Screw (6mm)    | M3 Screw (12mm)  |
|:---------------------|:-----------|:------------------|:-----------------|
| **Sensory Bridge**   | 4          | 4                 | 0                |
| **Mini Mast**        | 2          | 2                 | 2                |

{: .info }
The M3 nuts friction-fit with their plastic counterparts inside Sensory Bridge, and can be nearly impossible to remove without re-printing the whole shell. Make sure to buy some spares for experimentation.

-------------------------------------------------

## Rubber

Four self-adhesive rubber feet in a 20mm\*20mm square size give it grip:

## OSHWA UID

Sensory Bridge was certified by the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) with UID US002125 on September 15, 2022.

## Printed Circuit Board

Sensory Bridge and its accessory circuit boards are designed in EAGLE. There's a free version of EAGLE [that you can download here](https://www.autodesk.in/products/eagle/free-download) which should allow full editing of Sensory Bridge files within its board size and layer limitations.
