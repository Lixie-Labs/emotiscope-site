# emotiscope is **open**

Powered by a dual-core ESP32-S3, Emotiscope can be easily reprogrammed for any purpose you'd like! The firmware is [open source](https://github.com/lixie-labs/emotiscope) under the [GPLv3 License](https://github.com/lixie-labs/emotiscope/blob/main/LICENSE), so modifying it for your own purposes is quick and easy with PlatformIO on VSCode. You can even download the [board](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/tree/main/extras/OSHW/PCB) and [case STLs](https://github.com/connornishijima/SensoryBridge/tree/main/extras/OSHW/3D%20Printing) to build one yourself!
