# SENSORY BRIDGE is **FLEXIBLE**

While compatible with any WS2812B or APA102/SK9822-based LED strip (just use the screw terminals at the back!) there's also the option of using the **"MiniMast"**, a dense strip of 128 1.5mm RGB LEDs on a 260mm long PCB! It just plugs directly into the Sensory Bridge accessory port, making for a very portable solution!
